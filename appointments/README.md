# Installation

```
nvm use v14.15.0
```

When you're in the main directory, you can install husky by running (I think)
```
npm install
```

Then navigate to this directory (appointments)

```
cd appointments
```
Then build the source code:
```
npm run build
```
to generate the bundle.js which is used by the index.html.

Open index.html using live server if you want.
