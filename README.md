The repository contains two branches, both of which are their own independent projects with their own READMEs. If you're interested in the contents of the books you can take a look at them now:

* [Appointments](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-React-Test-Driven-Development/tree/appointments/appointments), a hair salon booking system
* [Spec Logo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-React-Test-Driven-Development/tree/spec-logo/spec-logo]), an online Logo environment for building Logo scripts
